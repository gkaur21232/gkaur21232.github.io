	My name is Gurnit, I really love anime, photography, food, and Drake. It doesn't get any more interesting than that.
	For fun I run a girls coding club at the middle school I went to. I am interested in AI and machine learning. Languages I  feel very comfortable programming in
	are Java and C. One particular language I want to improve upon is c++. After I graduate, I will be considering software engineering or machine learning.
